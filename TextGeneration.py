    User: Generate a high-quality image prompt for an epic sci-fi battle scene.
    AI: 
    Sure! Here's an optimized prompt for a cinematic AI-generated image:
    "An intense sci-fi battle scene on a futuristic alien planet, towering mech warriors clashing amidst neon-lit ruins, plasma energy beams piercing through a smoky battlefield, a cybernetic hero wielding a glowing energy sword, dramatic lighting, ultra-detailed 8K, cinematic composition, highly realistic textures, Unreal Engine-style visuals."

    User: Suggest a smooth transition effect for a motivational video.
    AI:
    For a powerful motivational video, use a **cinematic fade-to-white transition** between emotional moments, combined with a subtle **slow zoom-in effect** to build engagement. Alternatively, try a **dynamic whip pan transition** to create energy and movement, keeping the viewer engaged.

    User: Write a prompt for AI to generate a relaxing ambient music track.
    AI:
    "Generate an atmospheric ambient music track with soft piano melodies, deep reverb, and warm synth pads, designed for meditation and relaxation. The composition should have a gradual build-up, smooth transitions, and a calming soundscape with a slow tempo (around 60 BPM), gentle nature sounds, and a dreamy, ethereal quality."

    User: How should I structure frames in a 30-second cinematic trailer?
    AI:
    A well-structured 30-second trailer follows this breakdown:
    11 **0-5 sec** - **Establishing shot** (Wide landscape, slow pan, atmospheric music).
    2 **5-10 sec** - **Character introduction** (Close-up, dramatic lighting, emotional expression).
    3 **10-15 sec** - **Rising tension** (Quick cuts, high-speed camera movements, intense soundtrack).
    4 **15-25 sec** - **Climax moment** (Fast transitions, bold typography, action shots).
    5 **25-30 sec** - **Ending hook** (Fade to black, suspenseful text reveal, lingering sound effect).
    This structure keeps the audience engaged and builds excitement efficiently.

    User: Suggest a unique animation effect for a product ad.
    AI:
    Try a **parallax scrolling effect**, where background elements move slower than the foreground, creating depth and engagement. Combine it with **smooth kinetic typography** that dynamically follows the productâ€™s motion for an eye-catching and modern feel.

    User: Generate an AI prompt for a dark fantasy concept art piece.

A shadowy dragon looms behind him, its glowing red eyes piercing through the swirling mist. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, hyper-detailed, 4K resolution, dark fantasy realism, moody and cinematic atmosphere."
